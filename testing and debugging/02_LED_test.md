# LED TEST

1. flash the 'diagnostic.bin' to your pulse oximeter following the procedure in [FLASHING THE FIRMWARE](#fw_flash) section. 
2. The display will show which LED should be turned on. 
3. Check if all LEDs are turning on as the display suggests. If the two don't match, you have most probably soldered the wires the wrong way.
