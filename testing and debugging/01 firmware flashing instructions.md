Here are the files and instructions for you to test your pulse oximeter. 

# FLASHING THE FIRMWARE <a id="fw_flash"></a>

For flashing the firmware onto the MCU we are using the [Nucleo64 board programmer](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/user_manual/98/2e/fa/4b/e0/82/43/b7/DM00105823.pdf/files/DM00105823.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00105823.pdf).

1. Use the top 4 pins of the 6-pin connector (CN4) on the STM programmer to hook up the MCU.

|STM|GliaX main PCB|
|:-----:|:-----:|
|1 - VDD|5V|
|2 - SWCLK|CK|
|3 - GND|GND|
|4 - SWDIO|IO|

2. Connect your GliaX pulse oximeter with the PC with a microUSB cable and turn the switch to ON.
3. Connect the programmer with your PC with miniUSB wire.
4. You will notice a vew flash drive recognized on your pc NODE_L073RZ

5. A new explorer window will pop up with DETAILS.TXT and MBED.HTM files. Should you see FAIL.TXT file in this window, this means something went wrong. Check for hardware bugs on the PCB or faulty connections.

6. Drag and drop a .bin firmware file into this drive. The LD1 on the STM programmer should blink switching between red and green. Once thec copying is done, you've successfully flashed your firmware onto your pulse oximeter.

7. Press RESET button.
