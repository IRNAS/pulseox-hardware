For the assembly of this design you will need:

- 3D printed parts (2 parts)
- a kitchen rubber band (1 pc)
- Superglue
- Transparent nail UV gel
- 2-5mL syringe
- UV lamp

1. 3D print both parts (probe_out.stl and probe_in.stl)
2. use a little super glue to fixate the LED and sensor PCBs and cables inside the slots
3. fill the nail UV gel into the syringe (try to sink the syringe deep enough to prevent the air to enter it)
4. carefully seal the PCB slots with UV gel, try not causing any air bubbles to trap
5. place both parts under the UV lamp for 4min
6. remove the finished parts from the UV lamp and assemble them
7. place the rubber band into the outer slot of the finger clip
8. use alcohol to clean the gel surface (it might feel sticky right after stiffening)
